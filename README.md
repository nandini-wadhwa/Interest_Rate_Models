# Interest Rate Models in C++

Welcome to the Interest Rate Models repository! This project includes a collection of seven different interest rate models implemented in C++. Each model is designed to simulate and analyze the behavior of interest rates over time. Below you'll find descriptions of each model and instructions on how to use the code.

## Models Included

1. **Vasicek Model**
   - A popular short-rate model used for pricing interest rate derivatives. It assumes that the short rate follows a mean-reverting process with a constant volatility.

2. **Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) Model**
   - An extension of the Vasicek model that allows for stochastic volatility. It is commonly used in financial mathematics to model interest rates.

3. **Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) Model**
   - A model where the volatility of the interest rate depends on the level of the interest rate. It is known for its flexibility in capturing the changing nature of volatility.

4. **Hull-White (HW) Model**
   - An extension of the Vasicek model with a time-dependent volatility structure. It is useful for fitting the current term structure of interest rates.

5. **Ho and Lee (HoLee) Model**
   - A model that assumes the short rate follows a stochastic process with a time-dependent drift. It is used for pricing and managing interest rate derivatives.

6. **Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders (CKLS) Model**
   - A generalization of the CIR model that allows for varying degrees of volatility and mean reversion. It is used for more complex interest rate dynamics.

7. **Heath–Jarrow–Morton (HJM) Model**
   - A framework for modeling the entire term structure of interest rates. It assumes that the evolution of the term structure is driven by a Brownian motion.
